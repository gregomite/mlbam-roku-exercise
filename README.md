Roku Exercise
=============

Here is an implementation of the take-home coding assignment. I've added the date to the top right corner of the main view to make it clear which day you're viewing. 

- The first day will always be May 20, 2016
- Pressing the Up arrow on the remote will show the prior day's games
- Pressing the Down arrow will show the next day's games
